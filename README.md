Implemented the Dual Moving Average Crossover Strategy used for trading stocks using Python, Streamlit for developing and deploying. Also, backtested the strategy using the backtesting.py module.

## Dual Moving Average Crossover:

The Dual Moving Average Crossover trading system uses two moving averages, one short and one long. The system trades when the short moving average crosses the long moving average.
    
This signal is used to identify the momentum is shifting towards which average and accordingly decision is taken.
    
    Buy - when short crosses long average and goes up.
    Sell - when short crosses long average and goes down.
